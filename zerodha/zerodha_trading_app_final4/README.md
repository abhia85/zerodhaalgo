FINAL PACKAGE v2 - Steps implemented

What's added:
- Server-side request_token -> access_token exchange endpoint (kite_auth_exchange.py)
- Token expiry storage in DB and token handling in kite_client
- Streaming worker skeleton for low-latency ticks (workers_stream.py)
- Daily-loss enforcement checks in kite_client._validate_order
- Integration test script to simulate PAPER_MODE live run.

IMPORTANT next steps BEFORE live money:
- Run integration_test.py in tests/ with PAPER_MODE=true to validate behavior.
- Use a Kite test/paper account to exercise the exchange flow and real order placement in a controlled environment.
- Configure KITE_ENC_KEY securely and set MAX_DAILY_LOSS in env to desired value.


## UI Enhancements included
- Equity chart component (react-chartjs-2) wired to show last backtest equity curve.
- Trade Journal component lists recent trades from /api/trades.

## Tests
- backend/tests/e2e_test.py: end-to-end test script to create strategy, backtest, start live (PAPER_MODE), and list trades.


## Final gap fixes implemented
- Streaming worker now supports real websocket streaming via env KITE_STREAM_URL (if provided) and falls back to simulated low-latency polling.
- KiteClient exposes `get_login_url()` and `/api/auth/login_url` so the frontend can open the Connect URL and the user can complete login flow.
- `refresh_token_if_needed()` now returns False if token expired and the frontend can call `/api/auth/login_url` to reauthenticate.

## Next operational steps
1. Your friend should open the front-end, click 'Zerodha Connect' which calls `/api/auth/login_url`, complete login and then exchange the request_token using `/api/auth/exchange`.
2. After token is stored, worker will use streaming if `KITE_STREAM_URL` is set and reachable; otherwise simulated ticks will be used.
